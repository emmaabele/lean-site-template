# Arete Fellowship

We are extremely excited to open applications for the Arete Fellowship, a semester-long program for students who are highly motivated to think rationally about their potential to have a positive impact on the world. Not only will you learn how you can best make a difference in the world, but you will also join a community of game changers at Brown and around the world making the world a better place. 

This fellowship involves a weekly one-hour discussion with about an hour of preparation before each discussion. Additionally, fellows receive one-on-one career coaching to maximize their impact and think critically about their career ambitions.
