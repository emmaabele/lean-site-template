Introduction

Some efforts to improve the world can be much more impactful than others. Smallpox eradication, the abolitionist movement, germ theory, and the Green Revolution demonstrate what is possible when people come together to solve pressing problems. But these opportunities to do good are few and far between. At the other end of the spectrum, many well-intended initiatives are ineffective or even counterproductive. Doing good better is one of the defining challenges of our time.
 
Recognizing this need, Brown University Effective Altruism brings you the Arete [AIR-uh-tay] Fellowship to equip Brown students with the knowledge to do good in the world more effectively and the tools to think critically about their career ambitions. 
 
What Does the Fellowship Consist Of?
 
Each semester we select a cohort of students to join us for a rewarding semester-long fellowship. We strive to provide an engaging, valuable, personalized and enjoyable experience for each of our selected Fellows.
 
Through weekly readings and discussions, as well as workshops and career coaching, fellows will:
Use critical thinking to evaluate global problems
Hone ethical reasoning skills
Evaluate which global problems they could tackle using their professional careers
Gain actionable insight into what makes a satisfying career
Create career plans to maximize their impact and think critically about their career ambitions.
 
Who will benefit most from this program?
 
Students who have the ambition and drive to do the most good they can, will find this program extremely fulfilling. 
 
Brown University Arete Fellows will be:
Passionate about helping others
Excited to dedicate their career to doing as much good as they can
Open-minded and flexible, eager to update their beliefs in response to persuasive evidence
Open to exploring ideas related to a wide variety of global problems
Willing and able to commit approximately 3 hours per week for the Fall â€™19 semester, including weekly discussions and readings.
